This is a mini project completed by one of my classmates and me. It is made for classmates’ amusement, which is actually a very simple implementation of an online Texas hold ’em poker room, containing a simple UI but complete function of the poker game, and including making bets, adding chips, getting or overturning new cards etc. Multiple players gaming and chatting supported.
